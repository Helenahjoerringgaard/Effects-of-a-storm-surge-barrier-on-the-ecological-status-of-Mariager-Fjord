# Effects-of-a-storm-surge-barrier-on-the-ecological-status-of-Mariager-Fjord
Semester project for 2nd semester Water and Environmental Engineering, AAU

This project used two models to investigate the effects a storm surge barrier has on the ecological status of Mariager Fjord, Denmark.
The ecological model is a MATLAB script that simulates concentrations of nitrogen, phosphor (organic and inorganic) and chlorofyl a for 2050 in Denmark.
The hydrodynamic model is made in MIKE 21 FLOW MODEL FM and simulates water levels of Mariager Fjord during a storm event in 2050. The hydrodynamic model is used to asses the time the barrier is closed, thus preventing an exchange flow between the estuary and the sea. This is used as an input in the ecological model.
